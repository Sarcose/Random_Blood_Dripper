# Random_Blood_Dripper
Because trying to find ambient sound effects is annoying and I needed a very simple and unpredictable blood drip for my D&amp;D game.

Just whipped this up real quickly to make something creepy. It's not a game nor is it really meant for use in one, although the code is simple enough to implement.
